*Source:* Hacker News  
*Published:* Thu, 08 May 2025 17:02:10 +0000  
*Category:* Guide

### 5 Key Bullet Points
- **Reservoir Sampling Basics**: Reservoir sampling is a technique used to select a random sample from an unknown-sized data stream, ensuring each item has an equal chance of being chosen.
- **Mathematical Explanation**: The algorithm operates by assigning a 1/n probability for each new item to be selected, where n is the number of items seen so far, maintaining fairness in selection.
- **Implementation Method**: Implementing reservoir sampling involves maintaining a reservoir of size k and replacing elements based on random indices to ensure fair sampling.
- **Application in Log Collection**: In log collection services, reservoir sampling can manage spikes by limiting the number of logs processed per second, ensuring system stability without overwhelming resources.
- **Extension and Variants**: The technique can be extended to select multiple items with a k/n probability, and there are weighted variants available for cases where some items need higher selection priority.

### 3 Deep Insights
- **Fairness and Efficiency**: Reservoir sampling elegantly balances fairness and efficiency, allowing for random selection without needing to store all items, which is crucial for handling large data streams or memory-constrained environments.
- **Real-World Applicability**: The algorithm is particularly useful in real-time data processing scenarios, such as log management, where input size is unpredictable, and resource usage must remain constant despite fluctuations in data volume.
- **Adaptability and Extensions**: While the basic form of reservoir sampling ensures equal probability selection, its adaptability through weighted variants allows it to cater to more complex scenarios where certain data points have differing importance, showcasing its versatility in practical applications.
