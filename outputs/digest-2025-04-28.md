1. PyXL is a custom hardware processor that executes Python directly without interpreter or JIT, running at 100MHz on an FPGA.
2. PyXL is significantly faster than MicroPython, with a GPIO roundtrip latency of 480ns compared to ~15,000ns on MicroPython (PyBoard). This represents a 30x speedup or a normalized 50x advantage when considering clock speeds.
3. The speed improvement is due to the lack of an interpreter and software stack in PyXL, allowing for deterministic timing, real-time behavior, and sub-microsecond precision in Python.
4. GPIO access in PyXL is physically wired to the processor, bypassing the need for function calls and a virtual machine.
5. PyXL compiles Python code into CPython Bytecode and then further into PyXL assembly, generating a binary that is sent to the FPGA for execution. This design eliminates the overhead of a software-based virtual machine.
6. The differences in test code between PyXL and MicroPython are due to platform-specific hardware access API calls and compensation for jitter and cold cache in MicroPython. PyXL is fully deterministic, returning consistent results.
7. PyXL's speed advantage makes it suitable for real-time use cases.

*Published:* Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:29:39 +0000  
*Category:* 1. Title: Deconstructing the Ski Jump Mechanics in "The Great Winter Sports Game"

  2. Introduction:
In this section, we will dive into the mechanics of the ski jumping event in "The Great Winter Sports Game". We'll explore how players can optimize their jumps for maximum distance and points, and uncover any hidden tips or tricks.

  3. Jump Mechanics:
- Player input: The player controls the skier by tilting left and right to gain or lose speed during the jump. Timing is crucial as too early or too late can result in a shorter jump.
- Takeoff: At the takeoff ramp, players should aim for a balance between speed and angle. A steeper angle will result in more airtime but less speed upon landing, while a flatter angle will provide more speed but less airtime.
- Ski tip positioning: Adjusting the ski tips (nose up or down) can affect the trajectory of the jump. Pointing the nose up will increase height at the cost of distance, while pointing it down will decrease height and increase distance.
- In-air maneuvers: Players can perform various in-air maneuvers such as spinning or corkscrews to gain bonus points. The timing and execution of these maneuvers are critical for maximizing their impact on the final score.
- Landing: A successful landing requires the skier to maintain speed upon landing, keep their skis parallel, and avoid crossing their legs (skis). Landings that meet these criteria will result in a higher score.

  4. Tips and Tricks:
- Mastering the takeoff angle: Practice jumping at various angles to find the ideal balance between height and distance for your playstyle.
- Timing in-air maneuvers: To perform perfect maneuvers, time your rotations to match the rhythm of the music. This can help ensure that you execute them at the right moments.
- Maintaining speed upon landing: Land with your skis parallel and avoid crossing your legs to maintain speed and maximize your score.
- Practice and patience: As with any skill, practice makes perfect. Spend time experimenting with different techniques to find what works best for you.

  5. Conclusion:
In this write-up, we've explored the mechanics of the ski jumping event in "The Great Winter Sports Game" and provided tips for mastering it. Now that we understand how the game works, we can focus on competing against friends or challenging ourselves to set new high scores.

Happy skiing!

*Source:* Pragmatic Programmer  
*Published:* Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:53:20 GMT  
*Category:* 1. Classification of Job Requirements and Candidates:

The current system is no longer effective for recruiting full-remote positions, especially for technical roles, due to the widespread use of AI tools by candidates. This includes language models like ChatGPT, voice recognition software, and overlay tools designed to help pass coding interviews undetected. The best signals come from proactive, human candidates who demonstrate genuine interest in the company and fit the role.

2. Return of In-Person Interviews:

Some companies are considering introducing in-person final interview loops despite being fully remote, due to incidents of mishires caused by candidates grossly overrepresenting their skillset and fabricating personal background information. In-person interviews could potentially reduce the risk of such incidents, but they may also introduce biases and increase costs for both candidates and the company.

3. LinkedIn Job Postings:

LinkedIn is becoming increasingly problematic for advertising vacancies due to its sheer volume of applications, making it difficult to sift through potential candidates effectively. Companies are now focusing on warm referrals as a more reliable hiring metric, skipping in-person interviews when there's a warm referral if the applicant is legitimate because a current employee has recommended them.

4. Solutions and Future Trends:

- AI tools for detecting AI-assisted applications: Companies may develop or adopt AI tools to help identify candidates using AI during the application process.
- Hybrid Interview Processes: A combination of online and in-person interviews could become more common, allowing companies to benefit from both methods while minimizing costs and biases.
- Increased Focus on Soft Skills and Cultural Fit: With AI tools becoming increasingly sophisticated, assessing a candidate's soft skills, cultural fit, and genuine passion for the role may become more important.
- Emphasis on Warm Referrals: Companies might rely more heavily on employee referrals as a reliable source of high-quality candidates.

1. The summary describes a scenario where traditional methods of remote recruitment such as job postings, interviews through video calls, and reliance on resumes have become less effective due to the increased use of Language Learning Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The author suggests that human interactions and genuine interest in the company are the best indicators for hiring, and that proactive messages from candidates on LinkedIn can be more promising than traditional methods.

2. A senior director of engineering at a fully remote SaaS scaleup shares an experience where they had to terminate a recently hired senior data engineer due to fabrications in their resume and lack of skillset. The company is now considering introducing in-person final interviews to reduce the risk of bad hires, despite the increased costs associated with travel and accommodation. The senior director also mentions that local candidates are preferred for lower travel costs, while those who can't or won't travel may be excluded from consideration.

3. The author discusses concerns about using LinkedIn to post job ads due to its perceived ineffectiveness. Criticisms include difficulty in sifting through numerous applications and the feeling that the platform has become almost unusable. This implies that companies are seeking new, more effective methods for hiring candidates.

Overall, these insights suggest a shift towards more human interactions and proactive candidate outreach, as well as potential changes to the recruitment process due to the increased use of AI tools by applicants. The return of in-person interviews is also being considered by some companies to ensure authenticity and skillset among candidates.

     - Brief overview of HubSpot's decision to abandon their traditional marketing funnel in favor of a flywheel model
     - Explanation of how the flywheel model encourages companies to consider the user experience as a whole and maximize compounding growth

5. Adopting the Product-Led Growth Flywheel:
     - Key takeaways from the interview with over 50 companies to create a PLG flywheel framework
     - Tips for businesses looking to transition to a product-led approach and adopt the flywheel model for sustainable growth

 The text provided discusses the shift from traditional marketing funnels to the Product-Led Growth (PLG) Flywheel model, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the user experience in driving growth for product-led businesses. The PLG Flywheel model is designed to generate higher user satisfaction and increased advocacy, which leads to compounding growth through new user acquisition.

The text explains that the metrics used for measuring PLG success include Acquisition (through Product-Qualified Leads), Activation (key actions within the product), Retention, Referral, Expansion Revenue, Average Revenue Per User, Customer Lifetime Value, and Virality/Network Effect. These metrics help businesses identify valuable customer segments, understand reasonable acquisition and retention costs, and measure the compounding impact of their flywheel.

The text also discusses the importance of understanding the difference between a viral product and one with a network effect. A viral product experiences an increasing rate of adoption as more users join, while a product with a network effect becomes more valuable for users as more people join, such as in the case of 2-sided marketplaces like Airbnb or social platforms like Facebook.

The text also mentions that HubSpot was one of the first companies to publicly adopt the flywheel model, recognizing that customers are a driving force for growth rather than an afterthought in traditional funnel models. The text concludes by stating that transitioning from funnel to flywheel is a critical step toward becoming product-led.

## [From product-led growth to product-led sales: Beyond the PLG hype](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/from-product-led-growth-to-product-led-sales-beyond-the-plg-hype)

*Category:* 1. The text presents a strategy for integrating Product-Led Sales (PLS) into a company's Go-To-Market (GTM) motion, which combines the best elements of product-led and sales-led approaches. This hybrid approach aims to create differentiated returns as startups move upmarket and traditional incumbents evaluate capturing SMB customers.

2. The strategy involves several steps:
   - Designing a new customer journey by mapping out user and buyer personas, identifying friction points within the journey, and defining potential touchpoints.
   - Building out new product-led experiences in increments, testing and iterating, measuring effectiveness, and making incremental improvements.
   - Creating an initial growth pod with decision-making power to lead the fundamental organizational shift within the company.
   - Providing sufficient budget to learn at speed, as a limited budget tends to lead to slow learning and eventual failure.

3. Key tools required for this approach include:
   - Customer Data Platform (CDP) to act as a single source of truth about customer data.
   - Product Analytics and Telemetry to track and better understand users' actions within the product.
   - PQL/PQA scoring and qualification models to identify and prioritize leads based on advanced algorithms that combine product analytics data with account intelligence and marketing behavior.
   - In-product guidance and engagement tools for smoother self-serve onboarding and increased adoption of new features.
   - Integration of the product, marketing, and sales tech stack to gain full visibility into how firms are faring at various conversion points in the customer acquisition journey.

4. The success of this transformation depends on open feedback loops among functions for effective change management. Startups that execute well could potentially face less risk of disruption, as today's differentiating factors may eventually become table stakes in the battle to win and engage customers and achieve above-average growth in enterprise software and other sectors.

 The text discusses the shift towards a Product-Led Sales (PLS) approach in enterprise software companies. The PLS approach combines traditional sales methods with self-service onboarding, product demos, and try-before-you-buy models to create a seamless customer experience.

The text suggests that transitioning to a PLS model requires several steps:
1. Design the new customer journey by understanding user personas, mapping out the flow, identifying friction points, and defining touchpoints.
2. Build product-led experiences incrementally, starting with small improvements and expanding rapidly based on learnings.
3. Create an initial growth pod with decision-making power to lead this organizational shift within the company.
4. Provide sufficient budget for quick learning and rapid growth in defined regions while proving the value of the new approach to stakeholders across the company.

The text emphasizes that startups and incumbents must consider the benefits of embracing PLS to avoid disruption, as differentiating factors may become table stakes in winning and engaging customers, achieving above-average growth in enterprise software and many other sectors.

Additionally, the text mentions the introduction of new tools and models into the tech stack for PLS such as a Customer Data Platform, Product Analytics and Telemetry, PQL/PQA scoring and qualification models, In-product guidance and engagement, Integration of product, marketing, and sales tech stack. These tools help to create a seamless, data-driven customer experience and provide insights into conversion points in the customer acquisition journey.

## [Venture capital is hurting innovationâ€”but the indie startup era might ...](https://ralionline.com/newsinsights/venture-capital-is-hurting-innovation-but-the-indie-startup-era-might-save-it/)
*Source:* Web Search  
*Category:* Opinion

1. Venture capital is shaping innovation, but current system is failing us: The article argues that venture capital demands exponential growth, which forces startups to focus on scale over profitability and sustainability. This leads to problems such as monopolistic tech giants, growth-obsessed startups, financialization of essential services like housing, and destruction of value instead of creation.
2. Venture capital destroys more value than it creates: The article suggests that because venture capitalists do not know which companies will be successful, they force every company they invest in to chase unrealistic growth. This can lead to exploitation of workers, shipping half-baked products, skirting regulations, committing fraud, and the collapse of promising businesses.
3. The problem isn't just the companies venture capital funds, it's the ones it doesn't: The article argues that entrepreneurs with great ideas that don't fit the venture model have two choices: take venture capital money and distort their business to chase growth they can't sustain or get no funding at all. This is especially dangerous in areas like housing and clean energy, where we desperately need innovation but where venture capital's demand for hypergrowth doesn't fit.
4. It's time for the Indie Era of Startups: The article suggests that there are entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers who want to build a startup ecosystem that rewards real value over speculative hype. The article proposes that now is the perfect time to help businesses like this succeed, as higher interest rates and a shifting market mean that companies must prove traction earlier. This could be the beginning of the Indie Era of Startups, where we can build an economy that rewards sustainable innovation.
5. Key takeaway: The article suggests that the current venture capital system is harmful to society, as it prioritizes short-term hype over long-term success and sustainable growth. It proposes that a shift towards alternative funding models and the Indie Era of Startups could fix both tech and the economy as a whole.
