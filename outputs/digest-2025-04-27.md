## [Dear SaaStr: Once Your Equity Vests In a Startup … Why Stick Around?](https://www.saastr.com/once-your-equity-vests-in-a-startup-what-are-the-advantages-of-staying-around/)
*Topic: SaaS | Category:  Opinion*

1. Founders and key employees who own equity in a startup are strongly incentivized to stay beyond the vesting period because increasing the value of their stake is significant.

2. Legacy: Once an employee leaves, their ownership stake becomes non-existent, making it crucial for them to remain involved if they want to retain any financial benefits.

3. The departure of a founding CEO or CTO often negatively impacts a startup, as the replacement may lack knowledge about the product, customers, market, needs, and company culture.

4. For VPs and employees owning 1% or more, the incentives to stay are similar but less impactful than founders. However, if they can add value, it is advisable for them to remain with the company.

5. Strong individual contributors may find it challenging to stay beyond 4 years without a promotion path or a "reload" grant. CEOs should consider re-loading their top performers every 2 years or so with new grants that vest over 4–5 years, as doing this for all employees can exhaust available shares.

## [That Super-Successful VP of Sales.  Great?  Or Just Lucky?](https://www.saastr.com/that-super-successful-vp-of-sales-great-or-just-lucky/)
*Topic: SaaS | Category:  Opinion*

1. The title "VP of Sales" from well-known B2B companies doesn't automatically equate to greatness or expertise in a startup environment.
2. Key indicators of a VP of Sales' true ability include their capacity for self-recruitment, personal quota responsibility and achievement, and evidence of promotions within the company.
3. Questions to uncover a candidate's real abilities and achievements at larger companies should focus on understanding their team recruitment, current/previous quotas, reasons for leaving, and ability to retain top performers.
4. A successful VP of Sales should be able to articulate their strategies, explain why they are drawn to startups, and provide specific examples of their accomplishments that are relevant to the startup environment.
5. It's essential to evaluate candidates based on their actual contributions and performance, not just their association with a successful company, to find the best fit for an early-stage startup.

## [Read the Obits](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-creativity-hack-no-one-told-you-about-read-the-obits/)
*Topic: EngineeringLeadership | Category:  The text provided discusses a method for boosting creativity by reading obituaries from the New York Times Sunday edition, focusing on small-print obituaries of people who are not famous. This approach is suggested because it exposes the reader to a variety of fields and professions that they may not encounter in their daily lives.

The text argues that by exposing oneself to diverse information, especially from conceptually different domains, one can strengthen their ability to make remote associations, which fuels creative thinking. The reader is encouraged to read the obituaries slowly without searching for a big idea and to ask questions about the details presented, such as the places lived, professions practiced, and odd hobbies pursued by the individuals.

The text suggests that this practice helps flex the creative muscle that thrives on curiosity and connection. The goal is not just to learn new facts but also to seek deeper principles at work in each person's life story and look for distant connections with one's own life. The text highlights two examples of individuals from the obituaries, Berta Escurra and Norton Garfinkle, and explains how their unique stories can help boost creative cognition.

In summary, reading diverse and conceptually distant material, such as small-print obituaries in the New York Times Sunday edition, can help boost creativity by exposing one to a range of fields and professions that they may not encounter otherwise. The practice encourages asking questions, seeking deeper principles, and looking for distant connections with one's own life.*

 The text you provided discusses the importance of exposing oneself to a wide variety of information from diverse domains to enhance creative thinking and cognitive abilities. The author suggests reading obituaries as an effective way to do this, particularly those in small-print in the New York Times Sunday edition. These obituaries are less famous individuals whose lives often span various fields, providing an eclectic mix of experiences that one would rarely encounter elsewhere.

Reading these obituaries slowly and without searching for a big idea helps fill the brain with different cognitive material. By asking questions about the details presented, such as why someone moved to a particular city or founded a specific company, one can stimulate creativity and curiosity. The author argues that this practice fosters connections between seemingly unrelated fields and encourages deeper principles to be sought out in each life story.

The text emphasizes that everyone has the potential for creativity and that it is a daily practice. The world's leading creativity researcher, Keith Sawyer, is mentioned as an authority on this topic, having published numerous books on creativity, including "Group Genius," "Zig Zag," and "Learning to See." He holds the Morgan Distinguished Professor in Educational Innovations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

## [Did 5G Kill the IMSI Catcher?](https://zetier.com/5g-imsi-catcher/)
*Topic: EngineeringLeadership | Category: 2. Classification: Cybersecurity/Mobile Networks

In this article, the author discusses the concept of IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) catchers and their impact on mobile networks. An IMSI catcher is a device used by law enforcement agencies or hackers to intercept and eavesdrop on mobile communications. The article provides an overview of how IMSI catchers work, their history, and the vulnerabilities they exploit in 2G/3G/4G networks.

The author explains that IMSI catchers are used to grab a user's International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), which is unique to each mobile device and can be used to identify the device and its owner. The article highlights that 2G/3G networks transmit IMSIs in plaintext, making them vulnerable to interception by IMSI catchers.

The author discusses how 5G networks have addressed this vulnerability by encrypting the IMSI using public key cryptography and creating a new identifier called the Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI). This change makes it difficult for IMSI catchers to obtain the user's identity. However, the article notes that there are still opportunities for IMSI catchers in 5G networks due to the multi-stage rollout of 5G and potential misconfigurations or non-use of the SUCI.

The author also provides some tips on how users can protect themselves from IMSI catchers, such as setting network priority to 5G-SA (if supported by their phone), staying in airplane mode until in a dense coverage area, and keeping their phone in a Faraday bag for signal attenuation.

Overall, this article is an informative and engaging discussion on the topic of IMSI catchers and their impact on mobile networks. It provides a good overview of the vulnerabilities they exploit and offers some practical advice for users looking to protect themselves from these types of attacks.*

2G, 3G, and 4G cellular networks have a vulnerability known as IMSI catcher (or Stingray) attack, which allows an attacker to intercept and eavesdrop on mobile communications, track the location of devices, and even impersonate a cell tower. This is done by tricking mobile devices into connecting to the attacker's device rather than the legitimate cell tower.

The vulnerability exists because the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) - a unique identifier for each mobile subscriber - is transmitted in cleartext during certain network events, such as initial attach and location updates. This allows an attacker to extract the IMSI from these transmissions and use it to impersonate the device.

However, the upcoming 5G networks have made improvements in this regard. The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is now encrypted using public key cryptography to create the Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI), which is transmitted in cleartext instead of the 5G SUPI. This means that even if an attacker intercepts the SUCI, it will not be useful for identification or geolocation.

Despite these improvements, there are still potential vulnerabilities in 5G networks due to factors such as multi-stage rollout, misconfigured towers, and the possibility of mobile carriers not using the SUCI at all. It is also worth noting that active IMSI catchers and active jamming remain viable options for attackers.

There is no way to fully protect against an IMSI catcher, but users can take some precautions such as setting their network priority to 5G-SA (if supported), staying in airplane mode until in a dense coverage area, and keeping their phone in a Faraday bag for up to 100 dB of signal attenuation.

Overall, while the 3GPP 5G-NR spec has made significant improvements against attribution attacks, it has shifted the problem from technical to geographical, and there is still work to be done in this area.
