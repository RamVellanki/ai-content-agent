## [Dear SaaStr: Once Your Equity Vests In a Startup … Why Stick Around?](https://www.saastr.com/once-your-equity-vests-in-a-startup-what-are-the-advantages-of-staying-around/)
*Topic: SaaS*

1. For founders and key employees, it is beneficial to stay in a startup after equity vests due to the following reasons:
     - Making the equity worth something is an incentive to stay.
     - Leaving means relinquishing ownership of the company.
     - More grants can be earned over time, although they may be immaterial.
     - The departure of a founding CEO or CTO often negatively impacts the startup.

2. For VPs and employees owning 1%+, the incentives are similar but less pronounced. However, if they can add value to the company that could potentially IPO, they should stay.

3. Strong individual contributors may find it tough to stay for more than four years without a promotion path or a "re-load" grant.

4. As CEO, consider re-loading top performers with new grants every 2 years or so, ensuring they are never fully vested. However, be mindful that continually distributing shares can deplete them.

5. At least give new grants to the top 10% employees every 2 years, topping them off with new 4-5 year vesting schedules, which may help retain key personnel.

## [That Super-Successful VP of Sales.  Great?  Or Just Lucky?](https://www.saastr.com/that-super-successful-vp-of-sales-great-or-just-lucky/)
*Topic: SaaS*

1. The impressive resume of a VP of Sales from well-known B2B companies may not necessarily indicate greatness, but rather luck or extensive help.

2. To assess if a candidate is truly great or just fortunate, additional questions should be asked during the interview process:

   - How much of your team did you actually recruit yourself?
   - What's your current team-level quota and what % of it did you hit last year?
   - Why / why weren’t you promoted?
   - Do you currently hold a quota or commit? Why or why not?
   - Who are your best 2-3 reps ever? And why? Will they come with you?
   - Why did you leave?
   - Will your boss say you’re one of their best hires ever?
   - What would you do first?
   - Why do you really want to work at an early-stage start-up?

3. The answers to these questions will help determine if the candidate's success was due to personal skills and abilities or the benefits of working for a well-established company.

4. It is crucial to ensure that the candidate has the necessary skills and mindset to succeed in an early-stage start-up, regardless of their previous employment history.

## [Read the Obits](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-creativity-hack-no-one-told-you-about-read-the-obits/)
*Topic: EngineeringLeadership*

 The text discusses the idea that reading obituaries from diverse fields can help boost creativity by exposing oneself to a wider variety of information, particularly from conceptually different domains. This exposure allows for remote associations and the strengthening of the ability to make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas or facts. Reading obituaries is suggested as an effective way to achieve this, as it provides a unique mix of fields and life stories that one might not encounter in their day-to-day lives.

To use obituaries for creative cognition enhancement:

1. Read the obituaries slowly without searching for a big idea.
2. Let the details wash over you, notice what sticks, and ask questions about them.
3. Seek deeper principles at work in each life story and look for distant connections with your own life.
4. Creativity is seen as a daily practice available to anyone through this process of curiosity and connection.

## [Did 5G Kill the IMSI Catcher?](https://zetier.com/5g-imsi-catcher/)
*Topic: EngineeringLeadership*

2G/3G networks have a network vulnerability where Initial attach, Crossing a Location Area Code (LAC) boundary, and Location Update Request conditions allow the Initial attachment message to be transmitted in cleartext, revealing the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity). This can be exploited by an attacker using an IMSI catcher.

4G networks have improved upon this vulnerability, but still use the uplink and downlink channels for Radio Resource Control, making it possible to grab IMSIs at PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) borders, older RAT (Radio Access Technology) borders, or when a device downgrades from 4G to 2G/3G.

5G networks have finally addressed this issue by encrypting the unique identifier portion of the IMSI using public key cryptography to create the Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI), and transmitting it in cleartext instead of the 5G SUPI. The SUPI and SUCI combination provides sufficient protection against identification and geolocation.

However, due to the multi-stage rollout of 5G and potential misconfigurations or lack of use of the SUCI, there may still be opportunities for attackers to exploit vulnerable networks.

There is no way to completely block an IMSI catcher, but setting network priority to 5G-SA (5G Standalone) can help, as most phones do not support this feature. Paranoia measures include staying in airplane mode until in a dense coverage area and using Faraday bags for signal attenuation.

Intriguingly, while 5G has improved upon the attribution attack issue, it has shifted the problem from technical to geographical, with active IMSI catchers and active jamming still remaining viable options.

## [Reverse Geocoding Is Hard](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/04/reverse-geocoding-is-hard/)
*Topic: EngineeringLeadership*

1. The article discusses a problem faced by OpenBenches, a crowd-sourced database of memorial benches with geo-tagged coordinates. The goal is to convert these coordinates into human-readable addresses.

2. Several APIs like OpenCage, StadiaMaps, OpenStreetMap, and Geocode.earth provide this functionality, transforming coordinates into addresses. However, not all locations have street addresses and providing the full address may contain too much detail for users.

3. The authors aim to display a rough textual representation of the bench's location and enable users to click on a component of the address to see other benches in that area. They also want to create URLs like openbenches.org/location/{city}/{country} for easy navigation.

4. Addresses should be concise, relevant, and in the language of the region. The authors struggle with stripping irrelevant details (such as postcodes) and providing addresses in non-English speaking regions. They also consider using nearby Points of Interest (POIs) as addresses.

5. To automate the process, they propose using StadiaMaps to get the nearest POI, translating it into English if necessary, concatenating its name and coarse location, and saving this as the address. However, they express concerns about the logical proximity of a bench to the selected POI.
